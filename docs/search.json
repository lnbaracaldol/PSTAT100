Submitted work falls into four categories:\n\nLabs will be assigned weekly in most weeks. These are structured coding assignments with small exercises throughout that introduce the programming skills needed to complete homework assignments.\nHomeworks will be assigned weekly. These are fairly involved assignments which apply concepts and techniques from the lectures and programming skills from the labs to real data sets in order to reproduce an analysis and answer substantive questions. Collaboration is encouraged, and group submissions will be allowed for groups of up to 3 students.\nMini projects These assignments prompt students to use skills from the course in an unstructured setting to answer high-level questions pertaining to one or more datasets. Mini projects should be completed individually, but discussion is permitted and encouraged.\nA course project will be assigned requiring students to carry out an open-ended data analysis. This will be completed in teams.\n\nOverall scores in the course will be calculated for each student as the weighted average of scores on all submitted work; the relative weighting and letter grade assignments will depend entirely on the score distribution of the class as a whole and as such reflect each student’s performance relative to their peers."

    "text": "Policies\n\nCommunication\nThere are two primary means of communication outside of scheduled class meetings: office hours and Nectir\n\nEmail\nCourse staff have limited availability via email. Course staff will make every effort to respond to individual communication within 48 weekday-hours on the following (or similar) matters:\n\naccommodations/extensions due to personal circumstances;\nlogistical issues such as access to materials or missing scores;\ngeneral advising.\n\nEmail should not be used to ask content questions or submit assignments (unless specifically requested). Emails related to the following (or similar) matters may not receive replies and should be redirected:\n\nTroubleshooting codes: Nectir\nChecking answers: OH or Nectir\nClarifying assignment content: OH or Nectir\nAssignment submission: Gradescope\nRe-evaluation request: Gradescope\n\n\n\n\nExpected time commitment\nThe course is 4 credit units; each credit unit corresponds to an approximate time commitment of 3 hours. So, students should expect to allocate 12 hours per week to the course on average. Course staff are available to help any students spending considerably more time on the class balance the workload.\n\n\nScores and grades\nScores on submitted work can be monitored on Gradescope to ensure fair assignment of course grades. On any individual assignment, re-evaluation can be requested within one week of receiving a score. Requests for re-evaluation made beyond one week after publication of scores may or may not be considered on a discretionary basis.\nDetermination of letter grade assignments is made entirely at the discretion of the instructor based on the assessments outlined above and consistent with university policy. Students are not permitted to negotiate their grades, and are discouraged from requesting audits, recalculations, or verification of self-calculations after the course has concluded. The instructor is under no obligation to share the details of grade calculations with students or to respond to such requests.\nIf at the end of the course a student believes their grade was unfairly assigned, either due to discrimination or without basis in coursework, they are entitled to contest it according to the procedure outlined here.\n\n\nConduct\nStudents are expected to uphold the student code of conduct and to maintain integrity. All individually-submitted work must be an honest reflection of individual effort. Evidence of dishonest conduct will be discussed with the student(s) involved and reported to the Office of Student Conduct (OSC). Depending on the nature of the evidence and the violation, penalty in the course may range from a warning to loss of credit to automatic failure. For a definition and examples of dishonesty, a discussion of what constitutes an appropriate response from faculty, and an explanation of the reporting and investigation process, see the OSC page on academic integrity.\n\n\nDeadlines and late work\nThere is a one-hour grace period on all submission deadlines. Late work will not be accepted beyond this.\n\n\nAccommodations\nReasonable accommodations will be made for any student with a qualifying disability. Such requests should be made through the Disabled Students Program (DSP). More information, instructions on how to access accommodations, and information on related resources can be found on the DSP website.\n\n\nFeedback\nToward the end of the term students will be given an opportunity to provide feedback about the course via ESCI. In addition, content-specific feedback will be collected for the Central Coast Data Science Partnership (CCDSP) at the end of the quarter. This information will be used to assess learning outcomes, understand student demographics, and plan further course development; input on the CCDSP survey is especially valuable, and a small amount of course credit will be offered for completion of this survey."

The course introduces central concepts in statistics – such as sampling variation, uncertainty, and inference – in an applied setting together with techniques for data exploration and analysis. Course activities model standard data science workflow practices by example, and successful students acquire programming skills, project management skills, and subject exposure that will serve them well in upper-division courses as well as in independent research or projects.\n\nLearning outcomes\nSuccessful students will establish foundational data science skills: critical assessment of data quality and sampling design; inspection and tidying of raw data; exploratory, descriptive, visual, and inferential analysis; and interpretation and communication of results for a general audience.\nThese skills will be discussed in depth during course lectures; students will practice them through lab activities, homework assignments, and project work.\n\n\nUCSB catalog listing\n\n\nDescription\nOverview of data science key concepts and the use of tools for data retrieval, analysis, visualization, and reproducible research.
